# DESCRIPTION

bcvk helps launch bootc containers using local virtualization.

a libvirt virtual machine, and connect with `ssh`.

The toolkit includes commands for:

- Running ephemeral VMs for testing container images
- Installing bootc containers to persistent disk images
- Managing libvirt integration and VM lifecycle
- Executing host commands from within containers
- SSH access to running VMs
